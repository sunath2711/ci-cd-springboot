# CICD spring boot project to understand how CI and CD work from code push to Deploying application


Stage 1

1) We set up github repo
2) Made sure i had docker desktop since would be runnnig containers on there
3) Also setup JDK , java 11 already was installed for me
4) The application was build with Springboot and Packaged with Maven

mkdir devops-ci-cd-springboot
cd devops-ci-cd-springboot
git init

git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>

5) Then we created pom.xml - project object model this is a single source of truth file that tells mvane how to build the application, what dependancies to download, how to package, what plugins are required - kind of heartbeat for building package with Maven  --  The contract between your code and your DevOps pipeline
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
         http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

This POM should be sonarqube + jenkins friendly 

6) Then we created the Main application Class
DemoApplication.java inside demo folder
 
   public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}

7) Then created Rest Controller with endpoints /hello and /health 

    @RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/health")
    public String health() {
        return "OK";
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(@RequestParam(defaultValue = "World") String name) {
        return "Hello " + name;
    }
}

8) Then unit tests were added - to run post each commit and finding failures in code at early stage itself , kept primitive for our use case , mostly regression kind of thing to find the code is okay and no case fails due to new code at an early stage itself

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class HelloControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    void healthEndpointWorks() {
        String response = restTemplate.getForObject("/health", String.class);
        assertThat(response).isEqualTo("OK");
    }

    @Test
    void helloEndpointWorks() {
        String response = restTemplate.getForObject("/hello?name=Sunath", String.class);
        assertThat(response).isEqualTo("Hello Sunath");
    }
}


9) Then we test locally by running "mvn clean test" to make sure the code is working is expected and tests are passing - also check the endpoints are reachable -- mvn spring-boot:run

10) Make sure these changes are done on any branch ( no issue with master too), and then git push to github repo 


Phase 1 completes all code setup for java springboot application, setup for maven tests and build, github repo with code changes

==================================================================================================================================

Phase 2 

GitHub (feature branch)
   |
   | push / PR
   v
Jenkins (Docker)
   |
   | mvn clean test
   v
Build Result (PASS / FAIL)

Objective is t run the jenkins server on docker container, build a pipeline that fetches code from github and execute the pipeline  to run maven and build the application into jar

1) Firstly on the host machine windows, create a directory that will persist all jobs,cred, pipelines for jenkins at ~/jenkins_home
       mkdir -p ~/jenkins_home

2) docker run -d --name jenkins -p 8081:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v ~/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
   this will help to run a docker container named jenkins with the image jenkins
   http://localhost:8081 - accesible here

3) On the webpage , we need to setup jenkins for the first time 
   docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/sec rets/initialAdminPassword  - execute in gitbash
    This gives the pwd for the first time setup 

4) Installed require plugins and setup jenkins with git, github, maven, pipeline and plugins required to execute the tasks


5) Now time to crea the pipeline, got to new item - pipeline  with name cicd-springboot

6) now on the code part parallel to app/ directory , create a very imprtant file that feeds the pipeline on what needs to be run in stages called the Jenkinsfile

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'feature/initial-app',
                    url: 'https://github.com/<your-username>/devops-ci-cd-springboot.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build & Test') {
            steps {
                dir('app') {
                    sh 'mvn clean test'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Only trying the maven clean test here, to check whether the jenkins container is able to execute the maven build through it
Push these code changes to git

7) Configure Jenkins Job

            In Jenkins job:
            Pipeline definition → Pipeline script from SCM
            SCM → Git
            Repo URL → your GitHub repo
            Branch → feature/initial-app
            Script path → Jenkinsfile

8) Why are we running Jenkins on Docker?
Short answer

👉 Consistency, isolation, and zero-pain setup

Long answer (real-world reasoning)
❌ Traditional Jenkins install (problematic)

Install Jenkins on OS, Install Java, Manage Jenkins upgrades , Manage plugin compatibility, Risk breaking CI when OS changes
Jenkins Container
│
├── Clones your GitHub repo
│
├── Executes Jenkinsfile
│
├── Runs:
│   mvn clean test
│
└── Reports PASS / FAIL

9) Jenkinsfile here basically is Pipeline as a Code
   Sometimes running the docker build command or docker run  commmand with gitbash and windows may add some extra lines or characters due to line continuations
       Shell	Line continuation
        Git Bash	    \
        Linux / Mac 	\
    PowerShell / CMD	 ^

On Windows:

Tool	Behavior
Git Bash	Rewrites Linux paths
Docker	Expects Linux paths
Jenkins container	Linux filesystem

That’s why:

//var/... works when moutning jenkins_home path volume

10) If Jenkinsfile is not at same level of app or inside it, it may give not found error what jenkins actaully does is create a workspace 
Explanation:
Jenkins first clones repo only to read Jenkinsfile
Then it runs the pipeline and does a second checkout
This is normal behavior

No at this point we hit another citical error where everything and build was started but due to no "mvn" present on docker container, the mvn clean test didnt work

when restarting and deleteing container jenkins , make sure when bring it up again w mount the same volume at jenkins_home that has stored all the data - can be seen at docker desktop inside volumes - that is persistent 

docker run -d   --name jenkins   -p 8081:8080   -p 50000:50000   -v 3df91a4c956902f68f78412c006b1fae2b3feb33ef4c69ee5058ebc5c0449258:/var/jenkins_home   -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock   jenk-docker-maven

the big hash is the volume in our case 


11) We had initally added maven to run as a docker from jenkins container itself like below to solve the problem where maven not installed and build test 
    agent {
    docker {
        image 'maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-11'
        args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
    }
} 

But this apporach has limitations and dependacies 
            Jenkins container does NOT have access to Docker daemon
            No /var/run/docker.sock
            So Jenkins cannot start maven: container

12) Then we manuallt installed maven on container itslef, to just check the pipeline working - ideal way should be to include in container image along with jenkins which is dont later - for now only installed on container directly 

Phase 2 achieved 
Jenkins running in Docker
✅ Persistent Jenkins setup
✅ GitHub SCM checkout working
✅ Jenkinsfile correctly detected
✅ Maven installed & wired
✅ mvn clean test executed
✅ CI pipeline GREEN

=========================================================================================================================================================================

PHASE 3 

GitHub
  ↓
Jenkins
  ├── mvn clean package
  │     └── target/app.jar
  │
  ├── docker build
  │     └── springboot-app:1.0
  │
  └── docker image ready

1) Now code is changed in stage build and test - mvn clean package - now additionaly we prepare a JAR at the end with all the packaged content 
This JAR contains:

    Your compiled code
    Embedded Tomcat
    All dependencies
    👉 This is a self-contained application


2) Now createa a dockerfile that has a abase OS  - java runtime andcpoy our maven created JAR into it,
  The purpose of this is using this dockerfile we are about to create an image tht can be deployed on any k8s cluster 
    Application - packaged inside JAR - JAR + jave runtime + dependancy bundle into image -> image deployed to any k8s cluster 

            FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY target/*.jar app.jar
            EXPOSE 8080
            ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]


3) also we adda new stage in our pipeline to build docker image 
       stage('Build Docker Image') {
    steps {
        sh 'docker build -t springboot-ci:1.0 .'
    }
}

Maven JAr is still being built on the jenkins container itself


4) We add another stage that wil give us the artiffact or JAR file post mvn package is done 

stage('Archive Artifact') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'app/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
            }
        }


5) Now we further modify the Dockerfile to  include a maven builder image inside itself
                # ---------- Stage 1: Build ----------
                FROM maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS builder
                WORKDIR /build
                COPY pom.xml .
                COPY src ./src
                RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

                # ---------- Stage 2: Runtime ----------
                FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre
                WORKDIR /app
                COPY --from=builder /build/target/*.jar app.jar

                EXPOSE 8080
                ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
Stage 1 (Builder)

Uses Maven image
Compiles code
Produces JAR
Throws away build tools later
Maven exists only during build

Final image does NOT contain Maven
Stage 2 (Runtime)

Only Java runtime
Very small image
Faster startup
More secure
            This was done intentionlly to transition from building on jenkins to now buildong on docker itself 

             GitHub
 → Jenkins
   → docker build
     → Maven runs INSIDE Docker build
     → Image contains final JAR


Acc to this mvane is no longer required on our jenkins container  


6)  VERY IMPORTANT POINT 

   Docker listens on /var/run/docker.sock - socket , Docker runs as a daemon - now my host has this file(windows)
   But since jenkins is a container that has docker isntalled but does not have docker.sock to listen to 
   this socket is a like remote control that gives access to build image, docker run, so we want our container to have the same access and permissions
   therefore we -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock mounted from host to container as volume 
   Jenkins container → talks to Host Docker daemon → builds images


7) since out container was up already, we faced some issues wtih brignging up with required volumes and docker.sock but eventually this worked

     docker run -d \
  --name jenkins \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -v 3df91a4c956902f68f78412c006b1fae2b3feb33ef4c69ee5058ebc5c0449258:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts

// - avoid translation of path 

8) We hit another error here when trying to check docker ps on the container itself 
Requirement	Needed?
Docker daemon	❌ (host provides it)
docker.sock mounted	✅
Docker CLI installed	✅ 

9) then we created a new image that had jenkins mvane and docker.io installed to remove this error
           USER root

# ---- Install base dependencies ----
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    docker.io \

This Dockerfile is NOT the Jenkins image → that’s separate (Dockerfile.jenkins)

This Dockerfile is the app image → your Spring Boot app in Docker

Multi-stage build makes image small and clean

Later, Kubernetes will use this image to deploy your app

10)  Since we had restarted the container ,maven got uninstalled - so add too to our image that already has 
     jenkins docker and now maven 
     and build it and then deploy the container jenkins again 


11) While runnig the docker build, we hit another error for permission denied since /var/run/docker.sock was root:root any non-root was not able to run the docker daemon
    since we had jenkins user , we added it to group docker and also changed this file ownership to root:docker to alow jenkins to make use of it 
        We also had root running the container but that time pipeline for some reason was not executing at the start itself and failing before clone itself

        This stage we ran into huge upsets with docker.sock and permission denied somehow unable to build image on the jenkins container despite eveythingin place


12) we used this dockerfile altering the chown for docker.sock 
    FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    docker.io \
    maven \
    && apt-get clean

# Add jenkins user to docker group
RUN groupadd -f docker && usermod -aG docker jenkins

USER jenkins

Adding group docker and adding jenkins to docker group


13) srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Dec 25 12:51 /var/run/docker.sock
    After this the pipeline was modeified too for build step 
        pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'feature/initial-app',
                    url: 'https://github.com/sunath2711/ci-cd-springboot'
            }
        }

        stage('Build & Package') {
            steps {
                dir('app') {
                    sh 'mvn clean package'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t cicd-springboot:${BUILD_NUMBER} app'
            }
        }
    }
}




14) and at last we reached here 

    #14 unpacking to docker.io/library/cicd-springboot:12 0.3s done #14 DONE 1.6s [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // stage [Pipeline] stage [Pipeline] { (Archive Artifact) [Pipeline] archiveArtifacts Archiving artifacts Recording fingerprints [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // stage [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // withEnv [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // node [Pipeline] End of Pipeline Finished: SUCCESS


Phew!!! Sigh of relief to finally find the pipeline running



Jenkins container didn’t have Maven → fixed properly
Didn’t hack pipelines; fixed infrastructure
2️⃣ Docker permission model
Didn’t run Jenkins as root ❌
Didn’t chmod 777 blindly ❌

Correct solution:
docker.sock mounted
Jenkins user added to docker group

=========================================================================================================================================================================


Phase 3.3 

After this phase, your pipeline will:

1) Build the application
2) Build a Docker image
3) Push the image to a container registry
4) Make the image usable for deployment (Phase 4 – K8s)

1) Now our task is to push the image created in lsat step to push to docker hub or any registry 
   Have account on docker hub - create a arepo - make a PAT - privata access token for it and add that to credentials in the jenkins credentials with read and write permission on repos 

2) we will tag images that we push in below manner 
   sunath27/cicd-springboot:${BUILD_NUMBER}
sunath27/cicd-springboot:latest


3) Updae the jenkins file with a 
   a) env variable 
        
    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = "sunath2711/cicd-springboot"
    }


  b) new stage to push image to docker hub registry post its build
     steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(
                    credentialsId: 'dockerhub-creds',
                    usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER',
                    passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS'
                )]) {
                    sh '''
                      echo "$DOCKER_PASS" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USER" --password-stdin
                      docker push $IMAGE_NAME:${BUILD_NUMBER}
                      docker push $IMAGE_NAME:latest
                    '''
                }
            }
        

4) What each new part does (no hand-waving)
withCredentials

Securely injects secrets
Not logged
Not stored in Git
Jenkins best practice

docker login --password-stdin
Secure login (no password leak)
Required for CI systems

Two pushes
One immutable (BUILD_NUMBER)
One mutable (latest)

here the credentialsId should match the ID given on jenkins for the particular credential

5) practically, push access was denied at the first time when pipeline ran - it was due to mismatch on docker image vuild and push 

      environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = "sunath27/cicd-springboot"
    }


6) when ran pipeline 

93616117f2ee: Layer already exists 911f2e67b724: Layer already exists latest: digest: sha256:86cb5f1d3c340a6365a5e1706fedc4aaee5a2f310c3d7eeb253973db60894e9b size: 856 [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // withCredentials [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // stage [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // withEnv [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // withEnv [Pipeline] } [Pipeline] // node [Pipeline] End of Pipeline Finished: SUCCESS


Completed phase 3.3 with image now getting pushde to docker hub  registry too

=========================================================================================================================================================================

PHASE 4 - deploy the image to kubernetes cluster [ very improtant of CD ]

By the end of Phase 4, you will have:

A running Kubernetes cluster (local)
Your Docker Hub image deployed on K8s
A Service exposing the app
A deployment that can be updated just by pushing new code


1) Frist to have kubernetes or k8s cluster , enable kuberntes on docker desktop that will giving us a running k8s cluster with anem desktop-control-plane node for our
   deployment to work on . NOTE: this is local on host right now
   Choose kind : kubernetes in docker rather than kubeadm 

Option	Description	Pros	Cons	Recommendation
kubeadm	Full Kubernetes cluster, like production	Realistic, production-grade	Complex setup, takes time, tricky on Windows	❌ Not ideal for local dev/CI
KIND	Kubernetes in Docker	Fast, easy, works on Windows, disposable, CI/CD friendly	Single-node (by default), not prod	✅ Perfect for Phase 4 / your CI/CD pipeline

2) check kind version on powershell/ bash 
   NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION 
   desktop-control-plane Ready control-plane 2m17s v1.31.1
 
   Now we require to have kubectl on our jenkins container since we will be running kubectl apply andother manifestapply from our jenkins container to deploy the application with our image created in last step 

   also we cannot directly install kubectl on the container with jenkins user, would require rooot permission 

Why Jenkins needs kubectl inside its container

Jenkins is the CI/CD orchestrator.It builds your code → builds Docker image → pushes it to Docker Hub.Next, it needs to tell Kubernetes “deploy this new image”.

Kubernetes API can be accessed in two ways:

Directly via kubectl CLI
Or via a plugin (like Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin) that talks to the API

If we use kubectl inside Jenkins, then in a pipeline we can run stages like:
sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
sh 'kubectl rollout status deployment cicd-springboot'


This executes commands from Jenkins container, which instructs Kubernetes (KIND cluster) to deploy your Docker image.
Without kubectl, Jenkins cannot directly interact with the cluster.

3) we then decide to extend our docker image to include kubectl from beginnning itself making a solid image with everhting we require 


RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    docker.io \
    maven \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    apt-transport-https \
    && apt-get clean

# ---- Install kubectl ----
RUN curl -fsSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt | \
    xargs -I {} curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/kubectl \
    https://dl.k8s.io/release/{}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl

Kind of locked in our docker file for building base image of jenkins container


4) To bring up the final container for jenkins with image jen-mav-dock-kube 

  $ MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run -d   --name jenkins   -p 8081:8080   -p 50000:50000  --add-host=localhost:host-gateway -v 3df91a4c956902f68f78412c006b1fae2b3feb33ef4c69ee5058ebc5c0449258:/var/jenkins_home   -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/Users/skhad/.kube:/home/jenkins/.kube -e KUBECONFIG=/home/jenkins/.kube/config jen-mav-dock-kube
  D5e0e4387445917d68f8058880f07af0c28ae68991f8064812b2b9fa0da027af


5) before we dploy through pipeline we try and build the pods and dpeloyment locallly on our machine with the image that was build previously to check if the image being made is correct before making it part of CD

kubectl port-forward svc/cicd-springboot-service 8080:80 - this will bre reuqired to acccess the application 
Why localhost:30007 is NOT working (important)

You are using KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker).

In KIND:

Nodes themselves run inside Docker container
NodePort is exposed on the KIND node container, not directly on your Windows host


6) We mount the kubeconfig of local host to the jenkins continer so that same cluster can be accessed and also set the kubeconfig 
 -v /c/Users/skhad/.kube:/home/jenkins/.kube -e KUBECONFIG=/home/jenkins/.kube/config

PTR : 
There are 3 different things that often get mixed up:

Thing	What it is
kubectl	Just a CLI binary
Kubernetes cluster	The control plane + nodes
kubeconfig	The credentials + endpoint to talk to a cluster

👉 Installing kubectl does NOT create a cluster
👉 Installing kubectl does NOT create kubeconfig

7) Now our kubecnfig og host was initally having 
   server: https://127.0.0.1:52636
  due to whic faced the error :
                      jenkins@854e71553fbc:/$ kubectl get nodes E1226 15:26:13.389015 154 memcache.go:265] "Unhandled Error" err="couldn't get current server API group list: Get \"https://127.0.0.1:52636/api?timeout=32s\": dial tcp 12 7.0.0.1:52636: connect: connection refused"


    Docker Desktop Kubernetes:
Runs the API server on the host
kubeconfig generated on Windows often uses:
127.0.0.1:<random-port> ❌ (works only on host)
Containers cannot access host localhost directly

    To remedy this : 
    we changed it to below 
      server: https://host.docker.internal:52636

    But again an error popped saying
          jenkins@854e71553fbc:/$ kubectl get nodes E1226 15:32:24.992061 112 memcache.go:265] "Unhandled Error" err="couldn't get current server API group list: Get \"https://host.docker.internal:52636/api?timeout=32s\": tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate is valid for desktop-control-plane, kubernetes, kubernetes.default, kubernetes.default.svc, kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local, localhost, not host.docker.internal"

      Translation:

Kubernetes API TLS certificate does NOT include host.docker.internal
It does include localhost
TLS verification fails → connection rejected ❌
So we fixed network reachability, but TLS hostname verification is now blocking us.


  Now finally changing it to  : server: https://localhost:52636
   wokred for us 
   KEY LEARNING

   also while spwaing jenkins container add  ----   --add-host=localhost:host-gateway
   this makes localhost (inside container) → Windows host || Jenkins → localhost:52636 → Docker Desktop Kubernetes API ✅



8) have deployment and service yaml ready for dpeloying the image cicd-springboot that is getting ready in previous step , the manifest be updated accordingly 

   and add this stage for deploying k8s 
        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
    steps {
        sh '''
          kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
          kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
          kubectl rollout status deployment/cicd-springboot
        '''
    }
}


9) Run the pipeline pods and svc come up with pipeline
   NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE cicd-springboot-service NodePort 10.96.208.255 <none> 80:30007/TCP 2m40s kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 10h skhad@DESKTOP-GIJB0HF MINGW64 /e/CICD-project (feature/initial-app) $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cicd-springboot-746b76b56f-q7vfn 1/1 Running 0 3m50s

   toverify pod is healthy 

               kubectl exec -it cicd-springboot-746b76b56f-q7vfn -- curl localhost:8080/hello

    port forwarding to check /hello : kubectl port-forward svc/cicd-springboot-service 8080:80

Phase 5 


Automatic trigger for pipeline on code push to github
Code push → Jenkins pipeline triggers → Image builds → App deploys to Kubernetes
this will all be taken care automaticly as we push to the main branch

Developer pushes code to Git repo
        ↓
Git webhook triggers Jenkins
        ↓
Jenkins pipeline runs automatically
        ↓
Docker image built & tagged
        ↓
Image pushed to registry
        ↓
Kubernetes deployment updated

Phase 5 – Building a Production-Grade CI/CD Pipeline

Goal of Phase 5
Move from “a working pipeline” to a trustworthy, observable, secure, and automated CI/CD system, close to real-world DevOps practices.

Phase 5.1 – Application Metadata & Versioning (CI/CD Visibility)
Problem Statement

At the beginning of Phase 5:

Jenkins pipeline was building Docker images - Images were pushed to Docker Hub -> Kubernetes deployments were applied

But:

There was no way to verify which build was running Pods looked identical across deployments
CI/CD success did not translate into runtime confidence

This made the pipeline opaque.
----------------
Design Decision

Expose build metadata at runtime, driven entirely by CI/CD, not manually coded.
------------------------
Key requirements:

1) No hardcoding version in Java
2) Version should come from Jenkins build
3) Version should be visible via HTTP endpoint

Implementation Steps
1. Dockerfile Enhancement

Added build-time and runtime metadata support:

ARG BUILD_VERSION=local
ENV APP_VERSION=${BUILD_VERSION}


This allows Jenkins to inject:

BUILD_NUMBER

or semantic version later

2. Jenkins Docker Build Stage

Updated Jenkinsfile to pass build version:

docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=${BUILD_NUMBER} \
  -t sunath27/cicd-springboot:1.0.${BUILD_NUMBER} \
  -t sunath27/cicd-springboot:latest .


Now:

Every image is uniquely identifiable, latest is only a convenience tag
-------------------------
3. Spring Boot /release Endpoint

Added a new endpoint:

@GetMapping("/release")
public Map<String, String> release() {
    return Map.of(
        "application", "release-info-service",
        "version", System.getenv("APP_VERSION")
    );
}

Verification

After deployment:

kubectl exec -it <pod> -- printenv | grep APP_VERSION
curl http://<service>/release


Confirmed:

Correct build number, Correct application identity, 
Learning

CI/CD pipelines must prove correctness, not just claim success.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5.1 (Extended) – Kubernetes Rollout Reality
Issue Observed

Running a new pipeline:
New image pushed
No pod restart
kubectl apply reported “unchanged”

Root Cause Analysis

Deployment YAML referenced :latest
Kubernetes compares manifests, not registry tags
If manifest doesn’t change → no rollout

Fix Applied
Jenkins Deployment Step
Replaced image dynamically:

sed -i s|IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER|sunath27/cicd-springboot:1.0.${BUILD_NUMBER}|g k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

Result

Each pipeline caused a real rollout - Old pod terminated - New pod started with new image - Rollout history incremented

Learning

Kubernetes is deterministic. You must tell it what changed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5.2 – Auto Pipeline Trigger (True CI)
Objective

Eliminate manual pipeline triggers and enable:
Event-driven CI
Git as the single source of truth
----------
Step 1: Exposing Jenkins to GitHub
Problem

Jenkins running locally on localhost:8081
GitHub cannot reach localhost
Solution: ngrok
Setup Steps (Windows)

1) Download ngrok binary

Authenticate:

2) ./ngrok config add-authtoken <token>

Start tunnel: only after this tunnel gives a claiamable URL we wil able to access the jenkins server from github webhook

./ngrok http 8081

Result:

Forwarding https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8081

Step 2: GitHub Webhook Configuration
GitHub → Repository → Settings → Webhooks ( add github-webhook) to the above URL while adding in github webhook
Payload URL:

https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.dev/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json
Events:
Push events
Active: ✅
--------------------
Step 3: Jenkins Job Configuration

Enabled:

1)“GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”
2)SCM configured for main branch

Verification
3) git push origin main


Observed:
    Webhook delivery: ✅ green (can check last delivery status in github webhook settings)

Jenkins pipeline triggered automatically
Full CI/CD executed

Issues Faced

ngrok binary not in PATH (Git Bash)
ngrok URL changed after restart
Webhook delivery failed after Jenkins restart

Fixes

Used ./ngrok.exe

Updated webhook URL

Verified GitHub delivery logs

Learning

CI is real only when humans stop clicking “Build”.
----------------------------------------------
Phase 5.3 – Code Quality with SonarQube
Objective

Introduce:
Static analysis
Quality gates
Engineering discipline
Setup
SonarQube
- another container with sonarqube is spawned 

Deployed via Docker
 docker run -d \
  --name sonarqube \
  --network cicd-net \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -v sonarqube_data:/opt/sonarqube/data \
  -v sonarqube_extensions:/opt/sonarqube/extensions \
  -v sonarqube_logs:/opt/sonarqube/logs \
  sonarqube:lts-community
0e48c8fb0ebbb01a7924d7775efa051ee2095acf1ec587043da148678cc05f8f

make sure the network for jenkins and sonarqube is same so that they can communicate ( here it is cicd-net)
then create volumes data, extensions, logs for sonarqube to persist data, by default data may get lost on container restart
-----------

Port: 9000

Project created: release-info-service

Jenkins Integration Steps
1. Maven Plugin Added

In pom.xml:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>

2. Jenkinsfile Configuration

Wrapped analysis:

withSonarQubeEnv('sonarqube') {
    sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
}

3. Quality Gate Enforcement
timeout(time: 5, unit: 'MINUTES') {
    waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
}

Major Issues & Fixes
Issue 1: Build Success but Pipeline Failure

Root cause: waitForQualityGate used without withSonarQubeEnv
Fix: Wrapped analysis correctly

Issue 2: Quality Gate Stuck in PENDING
Root cause: Sonar webhook not reaching Jenkins
Jenkins & Sonar in different Docker contexts

DNS resolution failed
Fixes

Connected containers via Docker network
Configured Sonar webhook:

http://jenkins:8080/sonarqube-webhook/
Added persistent volumes to Sonar (data loss prevention)

Outcome

Jenkins correctly received quality gate results
Pipeline blocked on failures
Sonar dashboard reflected each build

Can also check last delivery status in sonar webhook settings, initialy faced issue where webhook was in pending state
this was due to sonarqube and jenkins being in different docker contexts and unable to resolve each other via DNS
once they were in same docker network cicd-net this issue was resolved and webhook started working fine
Learning

Quality gates are useless without reliable feedback loops.

Phase 5.4 – Image Security Scanning (Trivy)
Objective

Introduce DevSecOps practices:

1)Shift-left security
2) Scan images before deployment

Trivy Integration
Initial Attempt

1) Tried installing Trivy via apt:
2) Failed due to Debian trixie repo mismatch

Final Approach

1) Installed Trivy binary
2) Ran scan inside Jenkins stage:

trivy image sunath27/cicd-springboot:1.0.${BUILD_NUMBER}

Issues Faced

First scan took ~5 minutes (Java DB download)
Timeout errors
Critical CVEs detected

Fixes

Increased Jenkins timeout
Cached Trivy DB

Accepted failures for visibility (not blocking yet)

Results

Detected:
CRITICAL Tomcat RCE CVE-2023-20861
Spring Web deserialization issue


To not fail due to critical right the exit code is set to zero instead 1, so that pipeline continues to run

Security becomes actionable only when automated.
-----------------------------------------------------
Phase 5.6 – Notifications (Email)
Objective

Provide immediate feedback on pipeline result.

Setup Steps
Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System

SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port: 587

Use TLS

Credentials:

Gmail App Password( this password is not the normal gmail password but an app password generated from google account security settings for third party apps)
U need to have 2FA enabled on google account to generate app password, 16 digit passwrd is created and that is used here in jenkins 

Test email: ✅ success

Outcome

Email sent on pipeline success/failure
Improved operational readiness

Learning
Silent pipelines are dangerous pipelines.
Phase 5 Summary – What Was Achieved

By the end of Phase 5:

1) Git-triggered CI/CD
2)Versioned deployments
3)Observable runtime metadata
4) Quality gates enforced
5) Image security scanning
6) Safe rollouts
7) Notifications enabled

------------------

Always check certain configs before deploying through pipeline
